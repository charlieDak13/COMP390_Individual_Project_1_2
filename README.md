This project asks the user to provide a file and then once the file is provided, gives many options on how to filter the data in the file. Once the data is filtered, it can be displayed either in the console, in a text file, or in an excel sheet, which ever the user selects.

To run this project you must have Pytest, xlwt, io, pathlib, datetime downloaded and imported in the project.
To use this program you will simply enter input when the console asks you too. If you enter the wrong thing, dont worry because it will only progress until a proper input is detected. You can also quit the program at any time when entering any of these inputs.
This meets all project requirements.
